# Layered Architecture for the Mobile App

## Presentation Layer (React Native)
- Components: Reusable UI components like buttons, product cards, etc.
- Screens: Various screens like Home, Product Details, Cart, Checkout, Profile, etc.
- Navigation: Manage navigation between different screens using React Navigation.

## State Management
- Context API / Redux: Manage global state for things like user authentication, shopping cart, product list, etc.

## Business Logic Layer
- Services: Interact with the backend APIs, handle data fetching, and business logic. For example, UserService, ProductService, OrderService, etc.
- Hooks: Custom hooks to handle specific logic, such as useAuth, useCart, useProducts, etc.

## Data Layer
- API Calls: Axios or Fetch to make HTTP requests to the backend Express/Node.js server.
- Caching: Optional caching mechanisms for offline access or faster performance using libraries like AsyncStorage.

## Backend Layer (Express/Node.js)
- Controllers: Handle incoming HTTP requests and send responses. For example, UserController, ProductController, OrderController, etc.
- Services: Core business logic and interaction with the database. For example, UserService, ProductService, OrderService.
- Routes: Define API endpoints. For example, /api/users, /api/products, /api/orders, etc.
- Middleware: Handle authentication, logging, error handling, etc.
- Database: MongoDB for data storage, accessed via Mongoose.
